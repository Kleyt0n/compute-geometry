## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/computational-geometry-python.git
   cd computational-geometry-python
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
